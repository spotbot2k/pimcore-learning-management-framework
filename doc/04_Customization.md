## The Template

If you wand the default template (it uses bootstrap theme) to look different just create your own at

``` bash
templates/bundles/PimcoreLearningManagementFrameworkBundle/areas/exam/view.html.twig
```

copy the contents of `vendor/pimcore-learning-management-framework/src/Resources/views/areas/exam/view.html.twig` and modify as you like.
